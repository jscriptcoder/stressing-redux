# stressing-redux
My second attempt to implement a redux application. Testing a little bit the performance. Lots of changes in the state with updates comming from a fake backend (setInterval with a random delay and values).

The program is writen TypeScript using ES6 Module System, built with Webpack, and has RxJS and Redux as main dependencies.
